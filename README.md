# mortgage-refinancing-nusiness-expansion
The Senior Data Scientist asked my team to engage on a project with Real Estate Mortgage Company (MortgCo).  
MortgCo is expanding their mortgage refinancing business to the state of Pennsylvania, where they are targeting households, who already own their real estate, but are still paying mortgage.

MortgCoâ€™s business problem is to find informative & descriptive attributes for profiling households and to build a predictive model which will discriminate between:
1. Households which own house with mortgage or loan (include home equity loans)
2. Households that own their homes free and clear
